# HSV-Alpha Color Picker for Android

This library implements a color picker and a color preference for use in Android
applications.

## Features

I couldn't find all of these features in any single existing library, which is 
why I wrote this one:

* Includes an Alpha slider.
* Includes a copy/pasteable text field.
* Displays old and new colors.
* Allows selection of "no color".
* Responds well to orientation changes.

In addition, the Hue-Saturation picker...

* gives higher hue precision than a square picker of the same size.
* allows easier selection of pure white than a circular picker.
